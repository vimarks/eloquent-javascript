# Eloquent Javascript 3rd edition (study companion)

### Origin
This repo came about in an effort to improve quality over quantity of time spent studying "Eloquent Javascript". I believe that Marijn Haverbeke's examples
throughout the book are the reader's path to full comprehension.  They serve as checkpoints of understanding and each deserves complete
understanding in order for knowledge to build.
 On completion of each chapter I intend to form the examples and explanations here into blog posts in order to help others on their journey through this great book.

### About
Explanations and take-aways are provided for most, but not all concepts and examples that appear in each chapter.  Exceptions are made if examples are cumulative in nature, their explanation servicing multiple examples.
